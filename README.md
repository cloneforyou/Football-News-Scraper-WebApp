#README:

#Python script using BeautifulSoup, urllib.request and smtplib to:
#- Make a request from a given website, in this case, a portuguese sports news website.
#- Use BeautifulSoup to retrieve html elements from the site.
#- Filter those elements using a keyword based method (see: listOfWords data structure)
#- Send the title and the body of the news by e-mail, with smtplib.

#Notes:
#Make sure that your e-mail account has the option to allow less secure connections.
